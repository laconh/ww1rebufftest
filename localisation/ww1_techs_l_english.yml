ENG_ww1_infantry2_equip:0 "Adopt Brodie Helmet"
FRA_ww1_infantry2_equip:0 "New Infantry Uniforms"
GER_ww1_infantry2_equip:0 "Adopt Stahlhelm"

FRA_ww1_infantry2_equip_desc:0 "With its blue coats and bright red trousers, the uniforms for the French soldiers has its roots on the late nineteenth century, and proudly portrayed the national colours. This demonstration of proud, however, would mean a serious problem in the battlefield, as this bright colorful clothes make living targets of the fighting men."
GER_ww1_infantry2_equip_desc:0 "The pickelhaube, the old leather-spiked helmet, worn by our brave soldiers since the early nineteenth century, could not hold on casual head wounds, such as those caused by shrapnel bullets or shell fragments. It is time to develop and mass produce a new, reliable, steel helmet to our Army. "

ww1_infantry2_equip:0 "New Infantry Helmet"

ww1_infantry2_equip_desc:0 "The hats and leather caps that have been assigned to our infantry are simply no longer suitable for modern warfare, and attempts to simply bolster these types of headware have had limited success. By adopting a new helmet, one made out of steel, we certainly won't be able to stop a bullet with any consistency, but our troops will be able to avoid casual head injuries much more easily."


ww1_ambulance1:0 "Horse-drawn Ambulance"
ww1_ambulance1_desc:0 "With the advent of modern horse-drawn vehicles in our army, we're able to standardize an ambulance vehicle, to quickly escort casualties off of the front line and into quick treatment. While they'll surely have a bumpy ride, and the conditions in these carts won't be particularly pleasant, it is surely much better than having wound treatment in the middle of an artillery crater."
ww1_ambulance2:0 "Motorized Ambulance"
ww1_ambulance2_desc:0 "Replacing horse-drawn ambulance carts with motor vehicles will allow us to evacuate troops from the battle much more quickly, which will help us save lives when time is of the essence. The improved horsepower vehicles will also allow for smoother rides and the ambulance to carry more supplies more effectively, which will further increase our return on casualties."

ww1_oil1:0 "Oil Extraction"
ww1_oil1_desc:0 "Oil and its uses have been known since the late 19th century, and sadly, most of our oil extraction ability dates much the same. Modernizing our oil wells will increase our take of this valuable substance to a good degree."
ww1_oil2:0 "Improved Oil Drilling"
ww1_oil2_desc:0 "Oil is elusive- it hides underground, where none can see it. For this reason, it's imperitive that we develop more efficient ways to locate it. By improving our oil drilling capabilities, we can find and, therefore, exploit more oil around existing reserves."
ww1_oil3:0 "Oil Worker Training I"
ww1_oil3_desc:0 "With the recent advances in the tools to find and extract oil, we cannot let our workers be the reason our efforts fall behind. By establishing training standards for oil field workers in both the private and public sector, we can make sure less oil is wasted, further bolstering our newfound reserves of black gold."
ww1_oil4:0 "Oil Worker Training II"
ww1_oil4_desc:0 "With the recent advances in the tools to find and extract oil, we cannot let our workers be the reason our efforts fall behind. By establishing training standards for oil field workers in both the private and public sector, we can make sure less oil is wasted, further bolstering our newfound reserves of black gold."

ww1_mining4:0 "Mining IV"
ww1_mining4_desc:0 "Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals and other geological materials from an orebody, lore, vein, seam, reef or placer deposits which forms the mineralized package of economic interest to the miner."

ww1_bergiusprocess_desc:0 "The Bergius Process is a method of production of liquid hydrocarbons for use as synthetic fuel by hydrogenation of high-volatile bituminous coal at high temperature and pressure."
ww1_rubber_processing:0 "Rubber Processing"
ww1_rubber_processing_desc:0 "We couldn't ever foresaw how important rubber will become and the dire time it happened. Further exploration of our recent breakthroughs in production of synthetic resources should help us in furbishing synthetic rubber to feed our war machine."

ww1_tools3:0 "Advanced Hand Tools I"
ww1_tools3_desc:0 "Even old pharaoh Menes would have been familiar with the hammer and nail, but modern industries allow us to produce more, superior, and standardized tools, allowing increased productivity in our workshops and industries around the world- so long as they can find that damned 8mm wrench..."
ww1_tools4:0 "Advanced Hand Tools II"
ww1_tools4_desc:0 "Even old pharoah Menes would have been familiar with the hammer and nail, but modern industries allow us to produce more, superior, and standardized tools, allowing increased productivity in our workshops and industries around the world- so long as they can find that damned 12mm wrench..."
ww1_tools4:0 "Advanced Hand Tools IV"
ww1_tools4_desc:0 "Even old pharoah Menes would have been familiar with the hammer and nail, but modern industries allow us to produce more, superior, and standardized tools, allowing increased productivity in our workshops and industries around the world- so long as they can find that damned 16mm wrench..."

ww1_camera4:0 "Military Camera II"
ww1_camera4_desc:0 "Improved stabilizers may help troops on horseback or in vehicles, and a camera useful for taking pictures from an aircraft would ensure that the army command see what the reconnaisance teams are seeing..."

ww1_fortification1:0 "Vauban's Works on Defense"
ww1_fortification1_desc:0 "Fortifications seem like a no-brainer to construct, and to a degree, this much is the case. However, effective design and positioning of forts is important to get any serious use out of them, and Vauban's Works, despite being published hundreds of years ago, still ring true to this day. Studying this will allow superior fortification construction."

ww1_fortification2:0 "Trench Excavation"
ww1_fortification2_desc:0 "Forts on their own are nice, but in today's Trench Warfare, integrating them into our existing trench systems would be even better. Construction of smaller forts that are interlocked with our trenches will not only give us superior forts, but also give troops in the garrison a far easier way out if need be."

ww1_fortification3:0 "Reinforced Concrete"
ww1_fortification3_desc:0 "Even the substance we construct our fortifications out of can still yet be improved. Reinforcing our concrete will lead to more stable, solid fortifications, less vulnerable to enemy artillery strikes."

ww1_fortification3b:0 "Defensive Bunker I"
ww1_fortification3b_desc:0 "Forts on their own are good defenses, but there's not much room or time to construct one when the trench line moves up. Bunkers, being smaller and much faster to construct, can help our defensive lines in fortified sectors stay secure."

ww1_fortification5:0 "Defensive Bunker II"
ww1_fortification5_desc:0 "Forts on their own are good defenses, but there's not much room or time to construct one when the trench line moves up. Bunkers, being smaller and much faster to construct, can help our defensive lines in fortified sectors stay secure."

ww1_fortification6:0 "Defensive Bunker III"
ww1_fortification6_desc:0 "Forts on their own are good defenses, but there's not much room or time to construct one when the trench line moves up. Bunkers, being smaller and much faster to construct, can help our defensive lines in fortified sectors stay secure."

ww1_fortification6:0 "Defensive Bunker IV"
ww1_fortification6_desc:0 "Forts on their own are good defenses, but there's not much room or time to construct one when the trench line moves up. Bunkers, being smaller and much faster to construct, can help our defensive lines in fortified sectors stay secure."

ww1_fortification4:0 "Anti-Aircraft Gun Support"
ww1_fortification4_desc:0 "The advent of Aircraft provide a new, quite difficult challenge to deal with when constructing fortification lines. It is a lot more difficult to build around a falling bomb than even, say, an artillery shell. Anti-Aircraft guns, therefore, should be set up to support our forts, and keep them defensible even in the modern war."




ww1_medicine1:0 "New Cirurgical Instruments"
ww1_medicine1_desc:0 "The era of surgery being a matter of bonesaws and booze is over, thank god. New instruments like the Hirtz Compass and new techniques for existing instruments like Intravenous Blood Transfusion should help to save several of our boys on the battlefield."

ww1_medicine2:0 "War Medicine"
ww1_medicine2_desc:0 "Bullets are not the only deadly force in combat. The grim taxman of death is well known to take his due toll on soldiers, especially in the stagnant Trench Warfare. Ensuring mass production of vitamins, antibiotics, and other chemical cures- and of course, making sure that they all work as intended- will lead to far less easily preventable casualties for our troops."

ww1_medicine3:0 "Sterilization Effort"
ww1_medicine3_desc:0 "No, don't worry, we're not starting a national vasectomy campaign. Part of the horror of war is filth- the image of a surgeon arm-deep in a patient with blood from another man on his hands is common, but not good. Ensuring there are appropritate sanitation measures taken for our medics can stop them from doing more harm than good."

ww1_medicine4:0 "Vaccination Campaign"
ww1_medicine4_desc:0 "No one enjoys getting a shot, but on the battlefield, being immunized to common diseases could save your life- no sick soldier fights well, after all. Though vaccination is still not yet fully understood, we know enough about the science to know that it's got direct, positive benefits- and who could resist saving more manpower?"

ww1_medicine5:0 "Hospital Modernization"
ww1_medicine5_desc:0 "Though our field surgeons are now all well and good, we cannot forget our proper hospitals behind the lines. Ensuring that these men have everything they need to deal with all possible comers suffering afflictions from shell shock to gas wounds, and even, perhaps, perform reconstructive surgery or other wild new techniques, will lead to even more men surviving a close encounter of the front lines."

hoi4tgw_decryption:0 "Decryption - Cryptanalysis"
hoi4tgw_decryption_desc:0 "Decryption is the reverse, in other words, moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext."

hoi4tgw_encryption:0 "Encryption - Cryptography"
hoi4tgw_encryption_desc:0 "Until modern times, cryptography referred almost exclusively to encryption, which is the process of converting ordinary information into unintelligible text."

early_antiair_detection:0 "Early Antiair Detection"
early_antiair_detection_desc:0 "Even though it isn't a so practical form of air detecting, a giant "ear", guided by a soldier, and pointing to the outer skies, could amplify the sounds of enemy airplanes' engines coming in, and give some time to our air force to mobilize, and to our civilians to get shelter."

ARMORED_TITLE_SUPER_HEAVY:0 "SUPER HEAVY TANK"

smoke_generator:0 "Smoke Generator"
smoke_generator_desc:0 "By adding fuel or specific chemical compositions to our engines, we can spell a dense smoke, that might save our fleets from being hit and let them retreat to home without being harassed."
basic_depth_charges:0 "Early Depth Charge"
basic_depth_charges_desc:0 "The Navy Ministry come up with an interesting invention: explosive weapons, that could be dropped on sea, to attack submarines."
depth_charges_advice_tt:0 "Explosive dedicated on attacking submarines"
